Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.


In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression that involves more than one explanatory variable.


Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome, target or criterion variable).



ASSUMTION 


Multiple linear regression analysis makes several key assumptions:


There must be a linear relationship between the outcome variable and the independent variables.  Scatterplots can show whether there is a linear or curvilinear relationship.

Multivariate Normality–Multiple regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.

No Multicollinearity—Multiple regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.  This assumption is tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values.

Homoscedasticity–This assumption states that the variance of error terms are similar across the values of the independent variables.  A plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values can show whether points are equally distributed across all values of the independent variables.

Multiple linear regression requires at least two independent variables, which can be nominal, ordinal, or interval/ratio level variables.  A rule of thumb for the sample size is that regression analysis requires at least 20 cases per independent variable in the analysis. Learn more about sample size here.
